Are you worthy of the Gods' favor? Will you be able to handle the risk for the divine rewards that await for you? 

Somewhere in Ancient Greece an early settlement of impressionable Worshippers built a Temple to foster their $FAITH in the Pantheon of Gods. The longer they stay in the temple the more their household's $FAITH increases. Using $FAITH the household can gather more Worshippers!

Gods pose the biggest threat to a Worshipper's $FAITH, greedy and looking to gain the people's favor certain Gods might woo and kidnap a Worshipper in order to get more $FAITH. But, the Gods and Worshippers were able to make a binding pact, as long as the Worshippers paid a portion of their $FAITH the Gods promised to steer clear of the Worshippers within the Temple.

However if a Worshipper leaves the Temple, the Gods may attempt to poach a Worshipper $FAITH. When a new Worshipper joins the settlement, the Gods look to kidnap and woo the new Worshipper.

God Game is a cutting edge risk protocol for Metis with Generative On-Chain Digital Art/NFTs utilizing tokenomics. It shows what’s possible with interactions between the ERC-20 and ERC-721 protocols. Your NFT can steal other NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) for you. The rarer your NFT, the more tokens you'll accumulate probabilistically utilizing the divinity mechanic. God Game is pioneering new types of digital art mechanics, usable on the Metis Blockchain. Fully decentralized. No roadmaps or empty promises.

The tl;dr:
 - There will only ever be 1,000 Gen 0, minted for .5 METIS each. The 4,000 Gen 1 are minted by farming $FAITH
 - Worshippers can be staked in the Temple to earn $FAITH and pay a tax anytime they claim their $FAITH earnings
 - If a Worshipper is unstaked from the Temple, the Gods try to steal all of its accumulated $FAITH
 - When a Worshipper joins the settlement, the Gods all attempt to gain a new devotee by stealing them. If they succeed the Worshipper is given to a randomly selected God.

Worshipper

You have a 90% chance of minting a Worshipper, each with unique traits. Here are the actions they can take:

Action	Notes	Risk
Enter Temple (Stake)	Accumulate 10,000 $FAITH / day (prorated to the second)	No risk.
Relinquish Faith (Claim)	Receive 80% of $FAITH accumulated on your Worshipper	Gods take a guaranteed 20% tax on relinquished $FAITH in return for not attacking the Temple. Taxed $FAITH is split among all the Gods currently staked in the Temple, proportional to their Divinity scores.
Leave Temple (Unstake)	Worshipper is removed from the Temple and all $FAITH is relinquished. Can only be done if the Worshipper has accumulated 2 days worth of $FAITH to keep them in the Gods' favor.	50% chance of ALL of your accumulated $FAITH being stolen by Gods. Stolen $FAITH is split among all the Gods currently staked in the Temple, proportional to their Divinity scores.
​

$FAITH

The maximum $FAITH supply is 5,000,000 $FAITH:

When supply reaches 2,400,000 $FAITH earned for staking, the staking “faucet” turns off.
The developers will receive 600,000 $FAITH
Community Rewards will be allocated 2,000,000 $FAITH
Action	Notes	Risk
Mint a new Worshipper using $FAITH	There is a 10% chance that the NFT is actually a God!	10% chance of the new Worshpper or God being stolen by a staked God. Each God's chance of success is proportional to their Divinity scores.

Gods

You have a 10% chance of minting a God, each with unique traits, including an Divinity value ranging from 5 to 8. The higher the Divinity value:
 - The higher the portion of $FAITH that the Gods earns from taxes
 - The higher chance of stealing a newly minted Worshippers or Gods

Example:
God A has an Divinity of 8 and God B has an Divinity of 6, and they are staked.
 - If 70,000 $FAITH total have been accumulated as taxes, God A will be able to claim 40,000 $FAITH and God B will be able to claim 30,000 $WOOL
 - If a newly minted Worshipper or God is stolen, God A has a 57% chance of receiving it and God B has a 43% chance of receiving it

Only staked Gods are able to steal a Worshippers or earn the $FAITH tax.

Action	Notes	Risk
Stake God	Earn your share of the 20% tax of all $FAITH generated by Worshipper in the Temple	No risk.
Claim $FAITH	Receive all $FAITH taxes accrued for the staked God	No risk.
Unstake God	Receive all $FAITH taxes accrued for the staked God	No risk.

Will you be the next to join the Pantheon of Gods? 

God Game has been inspired by other NFT ideas such as Vampire Game and Wolf Game, however being on the Metis blockchain God Game looks to take an existing concept and introduce an interesting technology to the Metis space.
